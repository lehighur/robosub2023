In order to run a program on startup we utilized Linuxs' systemd services. Specifically, the goal was to write a service (services are located in /etc/systemd/system/) that runs during startup, 
and calls a bash script to run our python program. That service is included (ScriptService.service), as is the script that it executed, these could likely be cleaned up in the future, 
and it is my understanding that trying to use ROS on startup could create some problems that we side-stepped by only using a python file.
